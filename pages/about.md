Hi! I'm Alex. Iâ€™m an engineer with experience in software, hardware, and audio production, and I'm passionate about sound, music, physics, and game development. I studied electrical engineering at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, and have since worked on a variety of projects, including digital/analog guitar pedals and amps, VST plugins, niche retro-revival instruments, pacemakers, and 2D/3D design software. I've also worked as a freelance audio engineer, mixing and mastering music and running live sound, although I spend more time in an IDE these days. When I'm not at my desk, you can find me playing music, rock climbing, riding bikes with my family, or skating with my dog.
