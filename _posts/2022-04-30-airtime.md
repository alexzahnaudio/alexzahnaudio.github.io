In April 2022, I teamed up with a few GDC Conference Associate friends to make a game for the Ludum Dare game jam. The theme was "delay the inevitable," so we made a game in which you're free-falling without a parachute and have to hit airborne objects to slow your fall.

We had 72 hours, during which I put together a relaxing Bossa Nova tune to accompany the player's impending doom. I recorded a little acoustic guitar track and some percussion, and enlisted my friends Kyler and Angelo (a.k.a. [Anzo](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1zPQUVj63POfqiPz9bofcO), whose solo music you should definitely check out) to play some keys and guitar melody over it.

[You can listen to the music here](https://alexzahnaudio.com/assets/audio/airtime-music.mp3).

I kept the sound design simple for this one. Just some air whooshing by, impact sounds for each airborne object mixed comically hot, and a tasteful scream from contributor Nick O'Connell.

Give it a try and see how long you can avoid the ground. WASD to move, and Spacebar to dive in case you're about to whiz by that airplane without hitting it.
